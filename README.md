# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Community Starter Kit

A GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that celebrates new user activity within your repository.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

Welcome new users with maintainer defined comments the first time your users:
- Create a new issue
- Open a new pull request
- Merge their first pull request

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
